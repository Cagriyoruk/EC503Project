# EC503Project
## Data
* This dataset is provided from BBC news. (D. Greene and P. Cunningham. "Practical Solutions to the Problem of Diagonal Dominance in Kernel Document Clustering", Proc. ICML 2006.).

* Our dataset consists of 1500 news from 5 different categories. Business, entertainment, politics, sports and tech. 

* We put all the news documents in a 300x5 matrix. Where each column represents a news category.   

*  The columns represents business, entertainment, politics, sports and tech categories respectively.

* We split the whole dataset by 8:2 ratio. That makes 1200 news for Train and 300 news for Test.
## Preprocessing
* In order to make use of raw text documents, we have to preproces them. Our preprocessing steps are:
  * Case Folding: Changing letters to lowercases and getting rid of any special characters.
  * Tokenizing: The process of reducing the text into it's individual.
  * Filtering: Dispose conjunction words and unnecessary words such as 'am','is','are', that doesn't give us any information about category labels.
  * Lemmatisation: This is a tecnique for reducing the words onto their root form. 
  
 * Use a bag of words model to find the most frequent 10 words for each category, total 50 words. Then select each unique word to determine the feature words. 

* The Word_list.mat file contains Most frequent words for each category that can be seen from the table.

 ## Term-Weighting
 * After completing the text preprocessing, we re-weight all the news using a method called TF-IDF.
    * TF: Term weighting based on the words frequency that appear in a document. 
    * IDF: Weighting method based on number of words that appear throughout all the documents.
 * You can understand the intuition behind the method with the formula given down below.

* After re-weighting the documents we get four matrices that our crucial to our ML model.
    * Xtr: Train set that contains weights of 1200 news / 1200x38 Matrix
    * Xte: Test set that contains weights of  300 news / 300x38 Matrix
    * Ytr: Train labels of the weights that corresponds to the news category / 1200x1 Matrix
    * Yte: Test labels of the weights that corresponds to the news category / 300x1 Matrix
